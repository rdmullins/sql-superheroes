## Roger Mullins

## Requirements

Create the backend for Facebook for Superheroes and an interactive shell script with the help of python that helps superheroes stay in touch with their friends and keep track of supervillains through the terminal.

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
- Create a Connection to a gitpod Database using Python 3 and view the database (using pgAdmin)
- The supplied superheroes.sql Database file contains create table and insert statements to get you started. (Do not modify the SQL file directly. Use CRUD operations to achieve CRUD)
- Decide on a minimum of four CRUD operations you wish to implement (at least one operation for Create, Read, Update, & Delete) - document these in your README.md
- Raise proper errors for defensive programming.
- Interactive creation, update, delete of a hero in the terminal via Python script, with commands that are available for the README.md
