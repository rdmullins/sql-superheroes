# SQL Superheroes
## Roger Mullins

## Requirements

Create the backend for Facebook for Superheroes and an interactive shell script with the help of python that helps superheroes stay in touch with their friends and keep track of supervillains through the terminal.

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
- ✓ Create a Connection to a gitpod Database using Python 3 and view the database (using pgAdmin)
- ✓ The supplied superheroes.sql Database file contains create table and insert statements to get you started. (Do not modify the SQL file directly. Use CRUD operations to achieve CRUD)
- ✓ Decide on a minimum of four CRUD operations you wish to implement (at least one operation for Create, Read, Update, & Delete) - document these in your README.md
- ✓ Raise proper errors for defensive programming.
- ✓ Interactive creation, update, delete of a hero in the terminal via Python script, with commands that are available for the README.md

## Stretch Goals
Write and add to your script actions for your superheroes so they…
- ✓ Can have mutual friends
- ✓ Can add new friends
- ✓ Can have mutual enemies
- ✓ Can add new enemies
- Can add likes
- Can add dislikes
- ✓ Can have multiple hero abilities
- ✓ More interactivity in the terminal (i.e. a search of heroes, get list of heroes friends, add abilities, etc.)
## If you finish early
- ✓ Add info to your project’s README.md README.md Best Practices
- Share links and resources from this week to the Help slack channel.
- ✓ Find ascii art to add to your script output.
- ✓ Add your own flair to the messaging
- Add unit testing to your scripts
